Basics of Python Classes

In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. Classes provide a way to bundle data and functions together.

They define the properties (attributes) and behavior (methods) of objects.

Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) using classes and objects.

1. Class and Object

Class: A class is a user-defined data structure that contains attributes (variables) and methods (functions).

Object: An object is an instance of a class.
It contains the actual data and can perform actions using the class methods.

Example

class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Car Brand: {self.brand}, Model: {self.model}")

# Creating an object
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry")
my_car.display_info()
Explanation:

class Car: Defines the class named Car.

__init__: This is the constructor method, called when an object is created.

self: Refers to the instance of the object.

display_info: Method to print car details.

2. Class Components

A class typically has:

Attributes: Variables that store object data.
Methods: Functions that define the behavior of the object.
Constructor (__init__ method): A special method used to initialize object attributes.
Example of Attributes and Methods
python
Copy
Edit
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")
        
# Object creation
student1 = Student("Alice", 20)
student1.greet()
3. Class Concepts in Python

a. Encapsulation

Protects the data by restricting direct access.

Private attributes can be accessed using getter and setter methods.

Example:

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):
        self.__account_number = account_number  # Private attribute
        self.__balance = balance

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited {amount}. New Balance: {self.__balance}")

b. Inheritance

One class can inherit properties and methods from another class using the parent-child relationship.

Example:

class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("Animals make sounds")

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Dog barks")

dog = Dog()
dog.sound()  # Outputs: Dog barks

c. Polymorphism

Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

Example:

class Bird:
    def sound(self):
        print("Birds chirp")

class Cat:
    def sound(self):
        print("Cats meow")

def make_sound(animal):
    animal.sound()

make_sound(Bird())
make_sound(Cat())

4. Conclusion

Python classes provide a simple yet powerful way to implement object-oriented programming. 

By using classes and objects, you can create reusable and modular code, making it easier to manage and maintain complex applications. 

Concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism further enhance the flexibility of your programs.
