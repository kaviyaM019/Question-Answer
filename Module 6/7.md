Explanation of Simple Short Rate Class
This Python class, ShortRate, is a simple implementation of how short-term interest rates are represented and used in financial calculations. 

It focuses on calculating the discount factor and displaying the rate details.

Let’s go through it step by step.

1. Class Definition

class ShortRate:

class is used to define the blueprint of an object.

ShortRate is the name of the class, representing a short-term interest rate.

2. Initialization Method (__init__)


def __init__(self, name, rate):
    self.name = name
    self.rate = rate

The __init__() method is a constructor that initializes an object when created.

self refers to the current object of the class.

name stores the name of the short rate (e.g., "Rate1").
rate stores the interest rate in decimal form (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).

3. Discount Factor Calculation

def discount_factor(self, time):

    return 1 / (1 + self.rate * time)
This method calculates the discount factor using simple interest.

The discount factor measures how much a future sum of money is worth today.

Formula used:

D(t) = 1 / (1 + r * t)
​
 
Where:
D(t) → Discount Factor

r → Interest Rate

t → Time in years
Explanation:

A higher interest rate or longer time period reduces the present value of money.
The function returns the discount factor, which is useful in bond pricing and financial modeling.

4. Display Method


def display(self):
    print(f"Short Rate: {self.name}, Interest Rate: {self.rate * 100:.2f}%")
This method prints the details of the short rate in a user-friendly format.

self.name accesses the rate’s name.

self.rate * 100 converts the interest rate from decimal to percentage.

:.2f ensures the rate is displayed with two decimal places.

Example Output:


Short Rate: Rate1, Interest Rate: 5.00%

5. Example Usage

rate = ShortRate("Rate1", 0.05)
rate.display()
print("Discount Factor for 2 years:", rate.

discount_factor(2))
ShortRate("Rate1", 0.05) → Creates an object rate with a name "Rate1" and an interest rate of 5%.

rate.display() → Prints the short rate details.

rate.discount_factor(2) → Calculates the discount factor for 2 years using the formula.

Output Explanation:


Short Rate: Rate1, Interest Rate: 5.00%
Discount Factor for 2 years: 0.9090909090909091
5.00% Interest Rate → The rate is displayed as a percentage.

Discount Factor for 2 years = 0.9091 → This means that ₹1 received after 2 years is worth approximately ₹0.91 today with a 5% interest rate.

Advantages of Using This Class

Simplicity: Easy to use and understand for basic financial calculations.

Reusability: The class can be used for multiple rate calculations.

Efficiency: The discount_factor method quickly computes the present value of future money.

Flexibility: Can be extended with additional financial functions if needed.

Conclusion:

The ShortRate class is a useful tool for financial analysts, students, and developers to calculate the time value of money. 

It demonstrates how object-oriented programming concepts can be applied to solve real-world financial problems.
